# Redmine 1.0.1

### What is Redmine?

    Redmine is an open-source project management and issue tracking system that allows teams and organizations to efficiently manage and track projects.
    It enables easy tracking of tasks, deadlines, resources, and facilitates communication among team members. Additionally, Redmine provides the
    capability to document issues, problems, and questions, as well as fostering collaboration and organized project work among users.

### How does it work?

    An administrator configures the application, and then users create projects and tasks.
    Users track tasks, update statuses, communicate with team members, and share documents.

#### In Redmine, the roles are defined with varying levels of access and permissions, listed below from the highest to the lowest:

- Observer: The observer role has limited access to projects and tasks. They can view projects and tasks but cannot make modifications or leave
  comments.


- User: This role represents regular users who have access to projects and tasks with limited permissions. They can create tasks, update statuses,
  comment on tasks, and share documents.


- Manager: The project manager role is granted elevated permissions for project management. They can create, modify, and delete projects,
  assign
  tasks, manage team members, and track task statuses and progress.
