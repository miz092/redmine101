### User

In Redmine, a non-admin user has certain capabilities and permissions within the system. Here is a summary
of what a non-admin user can do in Redmine:

1. Create and Manage [issues](ISSUES.md): A non-admin user can create new issues, such as bug reports or feature requests, within the assigned
   projects. They can
   provide issue details, assign it to themselves or other team members, set priorities, and track the progress of the issues they are involved in.


2. Comment and Collaborate: Non-admin users can add comments, updates, and discussions on  [issue](ISSUES.md). They can provide additional
   information, ask
   questions,
   or provide feedback to facilitate collaboration and communication within the team.


3. View and Search [issues](ISSUES.md): Non-admin users can view the issues within their assigned projects or those shared with them. They can search
   for specific
   issues, view their details, status, and associated information. They can also filter and sort issues based on different criteria.


4. Update [issue](ISSUES.md) status and progress: Non-admin users can update the status and progress of issues they are assigned to. They can change
   the status
   from "
   Open" to "In Progress" and eventually mark it as "Resolved" or "Closed" upon completion. They can also update the percentage of completion for
   ongoing
   tasks.


5. Attach Files and Documents: Non-admin users can attach files, screenshots, or other relevant documents to issues. This helps provide additional
   context and information for issue resolution and serves as a centralized repository for related documentation.


6. Access Project Wiki: Non-admin users can access the project wiki and view or edit pages as per their permissions. They can contribute to the
   documentation, share knowledge, and collaborate on project-related information.


7. [Track time](TIMETRACKING.md) Spent: Depending on the configuration and permissions, non-admin users may have the ability to track the time they
   spend on specific
   issues
   or tasks. This allows for accurate time reporting and project tracking.

It's important to note that the specific capabilities of a non-admin user may vary based on the roles and permissions assigned to them by the Redmine
administrator or project manager. The administrator can customize user permissions to control what actions non-admin users can perform within the
system. Here you can find info about [roles & permissions](PERMISSIONS.md).

### My page

The [My Page](MYPAGE.md) feature in Redmine is designed to provide users with a personalized and streamlined view of their assigned tasks, 
projects, and important
updates. It serves as a central hub for managing your work within the Redmine system. In order to get information about a certain project there 
are two tabs to look for: [overview and activity](PROJECTINFO.md).
